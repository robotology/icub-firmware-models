# Embedded firmware generation
The coupling/decoupling subsystem is already configured for embedded software generation.

Its internal structure, reflecting the direct/inverse geometric problems data flow, is:

The source code is generated by right clicking on the `wrist_decoupler` subsystem, and choosing `C/C++ Code > Build This Subsystem`, in this way:

Once this is done, the .h and .cpp files contained in the WristDecoupler.zip generated in the main folder must be properly placed into the board firmware project. For example, with the EMS board:

that corresponds to the folder `icub-firmware/emBODY/eBcode/arch-arm/embobj/plus/mc`
