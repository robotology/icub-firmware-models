# LuGre Friction Model

The **LuGre Friction Model** is a dynamic friction model used to represent the complex behavior of friction in mechanical systems. It enhances traditional friction models by introducing state variables to describe the internal microscopic effects at the contact interface, such as stick-slip phenomena.

## Introduction

The LuGre model was introduced to overcome limitations of classical friction models like Coulomb and viscous friction. The LuGre model adds dynamics to friction, meaning the friction force depends on a state variable representing the deflection of the asperities between the two sliding surfaces. This makes the model capable of capturing more realistic frictional behaviors such as pre-sliding displacement, stick-slip motion, and varying friction with velocity. It makes use of a "bristle" analogy as in the picture below:

## Mathematical Representation

The LuGre friction model is defined by the following set of equations:

### 1. State equation
The state variable $z$ represents the deflection of bristles at the friction contact:

$$
\dot{z} = v - \sigma_0 \frac{|v|}{g(v)} z
$$

where:
- $v$ is the relative velocity between the two surfaces.
- $z$ is the internal state variable representing the bristle deformation.
- $\sigma_0$ is the stiffness coefficient of the bristles.
- $g(v)$ is the model of the Stribeck effect

$$
g(v) = F_c + |F_s - F_c| e^{-|\frac{v}{V_{th}}|^\alpha}
$$

$\alpha$ is typically equal to 1.

### 2. Friction force equation
The total friction force is given by:

$$
F_f = \sigma_0 z + \sigma_1 \dot{z} + K_w v
$$

where:
- $\sigma_0$ is the stiffness coefficient of the bristles.
- $\sigma_1$ is the damping coefficient of the bristles.
- $K_w$ is the viscous friction coefficient.

## Parameters of the LuGre Model

The model has several parameters, which need to be tuned according to the system being simulated:

1. **$\sigma_0$**: Stiffness coefficient – represents the rigidity of microscopic surface asperities.
2. **$\sigma_1$**: Damping coefficient – describes the energy dissipation during deformation of surface asperities.
3. **$K_w$**: Viscous friction coefficient – accounts for the viscous effect at high velocities.
4. **$F_c$**: Coulomb friction force – the steady-state friction force at constant velocity.
5. **$F_s$**: Static friction force – the maximum force that resists motion before sliding occurs.
6. **$V_{th}$**: Stribeck velocity – the velocity at which the friction starts to drop from static to kinetic friction.

## Friction Regimes

The LuGre model describes three main friction regimes:

1. **Pre-sliding regime**: Occurs at very low velocities where the deformation of the bristles governs the friction force.
2. **Stiction (stick-slip) regime**: Represents alternating sticking and slipping behavior.
3. **Sliding regime**: At higher velocities, the model behaves like traditional dynamic friction models with viscous and Coulomb friction components.

### Friction Force vs. Velocity
The following plot shows the friction force as a function of relative velocity. The LuGre model captures the Stribeck effect, where friction decreases as velocity increases from zero, followed by a steady Coulomb friction force.

## Conclusion

The LuGre friction model provides an advanced way to simulate realistic friction behaviors, addressing limitations in traditional models. By introducing a state variable to describe internal surface dynamics, the model captures the effects of both static and dynamic friction.

# Embedded firmware generation
The TorqueEstimator subsystem is already configured for embedded software generation. 

![TorqueEstimator](assets/TorqueEstimator.png)

The source code is generated by right clicking on the `TorqueEstimator` subsystem, and choosing `C/C++ Code > Build This Subsystem`, in this way:

![code generation](assets/Generation.png)

Once this is done, the .h and .cpp files contained in the TorqueEstimator.zip generated in the main folder must be properly placed into the board firmware project. 
For example, with the EMS board:

![project](assets/Project.png)

that corresponds to the folder `icub-firmware\emBODY\eBcode\arch-arm\mbd\torque_estimator`
